You have two dice: one regular 6-sided die
(numbered 1 to 6) and one 4-sided die
(numbered 1 to 4). You randomly select
one of the two dice and you roll it twice. If
your first roll was a 2, what is the
expected value of your second roll? You're
allowed to use pen and paper (no
calculator). Please explain your reasoning.
